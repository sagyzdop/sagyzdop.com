> Imagine the Godfather theme playing…

Some ugly stuff happened at home two years ago when I visited for winter break after my first semester at university. I haven't been home since. I hadn't seen anyone from the family except my sister. I hadn't met my youngest brother, who turned one a couple of months ago. I want to go back, and I also don't. The reason is complicated.

Let me front-load a few things so you don't have to play mental ping-pong while reading this. I am not writing this to cancel my parents. This is not a pick-me sob story either. And if any of this reads like me trying to sound "wise", just know: most of this is coping the way I’m used to – long, semi-pretentious, pseudo-intellectual contemplation in text form.[^1]

## My Father

My father lost both of his parents when he was about 14 or 15. I don't know how exactly they died or what the circumstances were. We've never talked about it, which means I also have no idea how he actually feels about any of it.

He never talked about his problems. Never complained. I only remember a couple of times when he had this look in his eyes that spoke about his sadness. I also recall him saying he had no one to rely on his whole life.[^2] He has an older sister and a younger brother – and he took responsibility for both of them. I wonder if I could've done the same if it happened to me.

He has worked in so many places it's actually crazy. He has every category on his driver's license.[^3] He even piloted a ship and operated a crane at some point. Growing up, he gave off this vibe of an all-knowing oracle who could solve any problem he faced. It was like I could ask him anything and he would know the answer – or figure it out.[^4] There is nothing he can't fix at home. He is a fair and just person. I think exactly these traits got him where he is now.

Everything I consider "manly" in myself I owe to his example. He set the standard for the kind of man I strive to be, and who I am now is hugely influenced by him. I see my father as a truly exceptional man, and I can only imagine what he could've done if his own father had been alive. And yeah – if he was alive, maybe I wouldn't be writing this shit.

### The Kitchen Table

My most vivid memory from childhood is my mom and me crouching under the window outside the house, hiding from my drunk father. I was about six or seven.[^5] I wouldn't call him an alcoholic though. It was never him drinking alone for days on end. He didn't get himself into trouble or cause harm to anyone. Well, except when my mom took a beating. But I wouldn't call him a wife-beater either, because I have seen a wife-beater, and he was far from that. But he definitely didn't know how to drink and did beat his wife. This is one of those sentences that sounds like cope even as I'm typing it, but it is the most honest way I can describe it.

He never hit me or my siblings though. Most of the damage happened in the kitchen for some reason. From what I remember, there was a lot of broken kitchenware, a couple doors, and a dining table throughout the years. The table one is interesting because we had that thing for like 10 years until one night he decided to obliterate it with a fucking hammer like in that scene from *Demolition (2015)*. Put a giant hole in the middle. That's one way to get rid of old stuff, I guess.

After that particular incident, he promised me personally he would never drink again. Like, it was pretty serious. He looked me in the eye, man-to-little-man as he said that. I believed him. In that moment, I thought the war was over, like this was the start of happily ever after. But after some time, the promise was broken.[^6]

The fact that he never hit me didn't mean he couldn't. Throughout the years, every time he got drunk, I was plotting escape routes. Not metaphorically. Literally. Where do I run, where do I hide, which door sticks, which window opens, what do I grab first. The helplessness wasn't just fear, it was the realization that I couldn't protect myself or my siblings, and I am terrified of that feeling to this day.

The last couple of days at home, I escaped the house looking for pepper spray. Couldn't get one because it was January 2nd and everything was closed, which is a stupid detail but it is burned into my brain. This fear got to a point that now I don't think I could even sit with him in a room alone. I know this fear is irrational. It is embarrassing. But I can't do anything about it.

I tried to square up to him even in my late teens. I couldn't do it. I can't do it now either. I don't think I could've done it even if my life was on the line. My whole body just wouldn't let me.

So yeah, I know what domestic violence is from experience.

And the really cursed part is that for quite a long time, even though I was upset, I was kind of okay with it. I had to accept the fact that occasionally my mom gets a beating and, you know, cries, and whatnot. There's a big fight after. In the most brutal cases, there might be talk about a divorce. Then relatives, maybe friends, come over and try to make peace between them. And it worked. Worked every time. Everyone involved was okay with all that afterward. Everyone accepted it, so I guess I did too.

There was also the fact that seeing it as something unfathomably terrible and terrifying would mean dehumanizing my own parents. And I had to live in that terrible family among those terrible people. That is scary at the very least. If you call them monsters, then what the hell does that make you for loving them, or needing them, or eating breakfast five hours later like nothing happened.

Moreover, no one told me that there was a better option. If anything, I thought that we were better off as a family. I thought that my parents were doing a good job not getting divorced and enduring through it. But now, I can't help but think that I would've had a much better relationship with both of them if they separated earlier.

It amazes me how my mother's parents let this happen. Like, don't you have some dignity to protect your own daughter? I keep circling back to that because it feels so simple. But I have some theories about why they didn't.

First, since my father was an orphan, they might have seen him as their own child and cut him some slack. Second, I have heard a couple of times that my grandpa from my mother's side had a drinking problem, so this must not be a first-generation thing. Maybe they expected it to work out as it did for them.

His friends wouldn't do anything about it either. At some point, I started to hate them because anytime they gathered, alcohol was involved, and they all knew that my dad was the odd one out, but they still let it happen. Maybe they didn't want to be the bad guy. Maybe they thought it was none of their business. Married couples should sort out their problems on their own, and I agree with that.[^7] But then why the fuck, when my mom decided that she wanted to divorce, did they all suddenly have something to say? Fuck you all, you fucking motherfuckers.

Moreover, now that I think of it, I realize that there is no one who could keep my father in check. Not among his friends, nor anyone from both sides of the family. No one to punch him in the face and talk to him like a man. No men, only pussies all around.

This motherfucker basically went unchecked for thirty years. In his defense, I guess it was necessary for him to survive.

People blame alcohol, and that's what I thought too. All my childhood, I watched him drink and go crazy, and I wondered if he was overdoing it because I saw other people drink and they wouldn't act up as much as he did. I stopped wondering when I tried it myself.

I am pretty sure now that the alcohol was not the problem at all. I have drunk and have been quite drunk. I fucked up big time once while being drunk, which I am still embarrassed about. But alcohol was never the real problem. Everything I did drunk I did because I wanted to. So I made the conclusion that he either has an extremely low tolerance for it and actually blacks out, or he uses it as an excuse to do whatever he wants. I don't know which is worse.

But why drink in the first place? And why are you beating your wife?

I thought maybe it was about money. I remember that the 2014 economic crisis had a pretty substantial effect on our family. There were times when we didn't have any money. There were a lot of arguments. But my parents managed. One thing I am thankful for is that they didn't involve me in these problems, even though I tried to get involved.

However, once the money came back, it didn't get any better. So I concluded it couldn't be that.

I think there is a lot of missing information that I don't have, so I can't make a reliable guess about the reasons behind this problem. But my guess is that my father is offended by life and upset about having no one to blame for his parents' death. A "Why me?!" kind of situation, I guess. As if the universe fucked him over, and now he is getting back at it at home.

I don't blame my dad for having problems. If anything, I think he's done an incredible job being orphaned at such a young age, without proper education, with no one to rely on. I just think that at 45 years old, you should've figured it out already. At least don't beat your wife, like вотафа пэпэ, шнейне?

### Father Issues

Once I got here from home two years ago, I got my ear pierced. People wondered what my parents thought about that. Well, not so long ago, my father found out. Let's just say he surely wouldn't pick a gay son.[^8] And this was from a text I got for the first time in two years of no contact:

> …cтуденте тобыр деген халықтың бір топ халқына жатасындар үкіметке де, ата-анасынада пайдасы жоқ қоғамның бір мүшесі…

His message was quite long and loaded. He tried his best to write up something meaningful, but it was quite hard to understand given that his literacy even in his mother tongue is around modern day 6th graders' level. Not me making fun of him, it will be relevant shortly. Important thing here is that this excerpt hinted at his contempt for a person like me. He seems to see me as someone who has no benefit to society, nor to his family, and I can only guess where he is coming from.

My first guess is that maybe he is jealous of me in a way that he doesn't even recognize. Maybe he feels like I didn't get what I have myself completely, but because he created all the conditions for me. Whereas he had to earn everything he has on his own. Maybe his efforts not getting recognized or acknowledged enough and him not getting the praise he deserves for it makes him so upset. Maybe exactly because of that, he doesn't acknowledge me.

Second guess is that education doesn't mean much to him, because everything he has right now wasn't earned by education.

I was told very early on by this very person that education is the best bet I can make, so, with their help, I did. I suppose he agrees with that, but feels offended because he didn't get a chance to get a quality education himself.

I noticed that he is really insecure about not having an education. At some point, I was helping him write emails to his foreign coworkers, and I remember him saying quite often, "Wouldn't that sound stupid?" I guess he has crazy impostor syndrome, and that, among "smart" people, he has to either keep quiet or undermine their smarts with his "life experience."

And me? I am like the manifestation of that insecurity that he himself created. Imagine having a severe fear of dogs and getting one for the rest of your life. Maybe I make him feel belittled?[^9]

I think that the only thing he does acknowledge is being useful to someone else. This rubbed off on me. And him telling me that I am useless made me lost. I lost any sense of purpose and had to look for it again.

Once in a while, he would throw a comment like: "The son of my friend already got a car," or something like that. Even if he never said it directly, this is the implied message I remember. This narrative became more prominent as I got older. I don't know how to feel about it.

I can't remember a single time he said he was proud of me. Nothing new here, classic scenario old as time.

The closest he came to acknowledging my achievement was when he posted my IELTS score on his WhatsApp, and his friends and colleagues congratulated him. He seemed to feel proud of himself. I felt so happy. But I don't remember him telling me anything about it. I just assumed that he was proud of me.

Funny thing is that the people from whom I felt the most support were my sisters-in-law. They all have kids younger than me for whom they put me up as a good example, proudly talking about me. I'd like to think that if only my dad had supported me like that, I would have been on top of the world by now.[^10]

The kind of relationship I have with my father is like a talking-stage situationship where you keep wondering, "What are we?" Sometimes I am pretty sure that he cares about me a lot. Other times, my existence seems to make no difference. Sometimes I even feel like he regrets the decision to have me.

Maybe I didn't turn out to be the son he wanted me to be? But then it's like, is that your or is it my fault. I'd like to think that I have been a good kid. I did well enough at school. I haven't caused any serious trouble in life. I was the "good example" for some people. I don't feel guilt.

And man, like, besides all that, am I not your son. Why am I the only one worried about our relationship? Do you even care? Should I care?

Come to think of it though, everything went south around the time I turned 14. I guess after that, I was on my own. How would he know what to do? He had to be the father he never had. So I can't blame him totally. I just think that at 45 years old, you should've figured it out already. At least don't beat your wife, man, come on.

## My Mother

Even among the most educated, well-spoken, and smart people in this country, I wouldn't trust any girl I know to have and raise a child. My mom was about my age when she had me. That's a decision she made willingly. She wasn't forced into it. There was love at some point. I understand why it happened. Still, I think she could've put a little more thought into it.

I don't see the birth of a child as something magical. It's not a blessing or a miracle. It's just biology. I was born at 8 months (allegedly), and lived in an incubator for the rest of it. I like to joke about my will to live and take pride in it because the technology was so relatively new, the reported survival rate was low, and this was on the outskirts of Kazakhstan in the mid-2000s. I made that fact part of my identity.

I am kinda upset at my mom because I had a shit ton of health problems at the start, but I'm thankfully pretty healthy now. To her credit, the ones that came after me out of that woman were all totally healthy and strong, which I am happy for. 

My sister got the most beautiful features, while my brothers are just my clones. My youngest brother turned one a month ago, and judging by the photos I've seen, he is an absolute unit. As a matter of fact, all my siblings are the tallest and biggest among their peers, and I am not on the small side either. I won't be surprised if I end up being the shortest of them all in 20 years. My mom is kinda badass for that, gotta give her that.

### Victim Blaming

For a long time, I was on my mother's side, trying to protect her from my "terrible" father.[^11] But at some point, I started to question if she really was a victim in this situation.

She let him drink even though she knew what would happen at home. You would think she couldn't prohibit him from drinking, and maybe she couldn't. But at home, there were theatrics like she had a spare life in her pocket. 

There were moments she willingly confronted my father, even though it was clear that it would get her beaten. She's the one who kept letting this happen over and over again, even though it was clear that it was not going to change. And she kept telling the lie that this is okay. That lie is a big part of why I was so confused about how to feel about it.

When I asked her why she would do this to herself, she said she did it for us. She wanted a full family at my wedding. What the fuck? She also tells me, "You will get it when you become a father." What does that even supposed to mean? What if I don't get married and never become a father?! Must I now get married so your sacrifices are not for nothing?

Frankly, I don't buy it. I think it is some kind of manipulation she's doing consciously or subconsciously. She is not doing it for us, she is doing it for herself. As a matter of fact, I think that is the only right way. You had your kids not for them, but for yourself didn't you? There is nothing wrong with that. The problem here is that she is lying to herself and to us about it. She chooses the option that puts her as the victim, and then she refuses to admit she chose it.

This is why when I see posts online about another case of domestic violence, I am skeptical. I have to try hard to empathize with my own mother, let alone with another victim. I hate that about myself, but it is true.

I get it. It is scary to go on without a husband when you don't have anything. Personally, I think she is afraid of the consequences of raising children alone. I would be too. It is totally okay to be scared.

But all of that would be valid if she admitted she was scared. Then maybe people, including me, would have helped. But no.

Instead, she frames it as a heroic act of self-sacrifice. Maybe it's a kink, I don't know. Maybe it is the only way she can keep her dignity intact.

And come to think of it, couldn't she really take care of two kids on her own at the time?

"Learned helplessness" is a term I had to google at some point because of my mother. She seems to frame her whole life as a series of unfortunate events outside of her control that happened to her.

When it comes to taking agency for something significant, she finds a reason for it not to be possible. It is never a choice. It is always destiny.

It is okay to be scared, and she is doing incredibly well as a mother of four and as a wife who lived with an abusive husband. I just don't think this is one-sided.

### The Guilt Trap

Unconditional love is what I thought I was getting from my mother. After I left home, she was the only one who kept contact with me from the family, other than my siblings. Initially, being upset with them, I was ignoring it, but after some time, it started getting to me. Every kind message she sent was a reminder that there was someone who cared about me, whatever I did.

But now I am more inclined to think that even those are from self-interest. Those messages from her feel like a guilt trap. I feel responsible for her suffering. And the way she phrases it, like "I do all of this for you, I blame only myself for it" – I don't know – it feels like emotional manipulation. I am infinitely grateful for all effort she put into making sure that I was okay, and for all the sacrifices she made for me, but I have to call out her bullshit.

I left home thinking that my parents were divorcing. But then she gets pregnant with my youngest brother. A brother is cool, but what the fuck. It felt like a generational betrayal. Now, two years later, she once again said that she made up her mind to divorce. A week later, she says she chose to stay because she pities him. Not a word about being scared. Still staying in a good light. Making a sacrifice for the good of my children, right? Pretending to take responsibility but taking no action to actually solve the problem.

From all this it might sound that I am more mad at my mother, and might ask why she, a woman, has to do everything, isn't my dad also responsible? Because it is not about gender, it is just that he doesn't have an incentive. Because if he leaves the family, he has no one and will die a miserable fuck in loneliness. Whereas she has both of her parents alive and will probably get the kids.

## The Kids

Having a kid is the most selfish thing you can do. You can't walk up to a stranger and easily sell them your ideas. You have to earn the right to be taken seriously. But with your kid, you can skip the pitch deck and go straight to production.

You can raise a little believer in whatever you believe. People dress it up as "legacy" and "family values" and whatever, but let's be real. A kid is the easiest person to imprint on, because they literally have no other choice for a while.

My parents never pressured me into anything though. I was free to do whatever I wanted to do. There were never any ultimatums dictating what I ought to do. They were mainly supportive. The only direction they gave me was to become a decent human. They respected me and my opinion, and even if they disagreed, they always listened. I am very lucky on that front.

But aforementioned circumstances have led to them losing any authority over me and my sister. My brother was not old enough to understand what was happening. After I left they tried to buy us off with expensive presents which we didn't ask for. Obviously, it didn't work. Their money doesn't mean anything anymore. I would much rather have a normal family than have the latest iPhone, but hey, I am not complaining.[^12]

People say you can't be a good parent, no matter how hard you try, your kids will hate you anyway. Maybe. Speaking for myself, though, I definitely don't have any hate in me. I think I could've kept a good relationship with both of them even now, after all of this, if I wanted to. It is my sister who took it personally, with my father in particular. It's like, man, she was the one who was waiting for you the most. Now she has you blocked on her phone. Doesn't call you papa or even say your name. This particular thing is sad. That's where you lost, man.

Funny thing is that they blame each other for losing us. Dad blames mom for turning us against him. Mom blames dad for us not taking her seriously. But it doesn't even matter for me anymore; which is easy for me to say being away from it, it is much brutal for my sister who has to live with them. I feel like a coward sitting in my dorm room not being able to do anything about it.

I gave up. But I tried though. All my life I tried to get to the bottom of it, to the best of my ability. I tried talking, I tried crying, I tried being straightforward, I tried being soft and understanding. I tried every tactic in the book – nothing worked.

## Me

The narrative I have been told all my life is that parents provide a lot for their kids, and kids should be thankful. People feel responsible to give back to their parents. I don't have that in me, and I am embarrassed about it. I have gratitude, sure. I just don't have this built-in sense of "debt" that everyone else seems to have.

I think the biggest loss for my parents is losing me at the very age where they could've finally gotten returns on their investments. They could've put me to use, and I would've loved that, because maybe it would've given me some purpose in life that I don't have to look for.

### Kindness

My only grandmother was my role model all my life. I praised her as THE example of kindness. A couple of months after I left, I got a very loaded message from her blaming me for what happened. It was the moment I lost any bit of kindness in me, and I felt betrayed and lied to. I do realize that no one is perfect, and idealizing her like that was probably a mistake on my part. Still, it fucked me up in a very specific way.

But what I got from this was the following fact: self-sacrificing care about others is ultimately harmful. At the end of the day, everybody acts from self-interest and should only act from self-interest. And whoever claims that they are acting in the interest of someone else is lying to themselves.

This shit made me cruel. I grew extremely skeptical of any act of kindness. I lost the ability to see good in people. But it allowed me to spot and call out people's bullshit more easily.

Besides that, being the eldest kid of the new generation in the family, I feel bad that I lost connections with the little ones. I was raised with the idea that as an older brother I was responsible for them, that I ought to take care of them and set the example. It would've been yet another convenient reason to live.

But now I truly believe that it is total bullshit. No one should follow anyone. I had my world shattered because I had role models that turned out not to be the people I thought they were. I don't want that to happen to any of them. I don't want to set any examples, because having someone as an example takes responsibility away from yourself. That's how you become a "victim".

The only thing I want to be an example of is being honest. Knowing the devastating consequences of lying firsthand I am deeply convinced that any kind of lie is a liability that most people cannot bear. Honesty is existential for me.

### Silver Linings

At the end of the day, there are at least some silver linings to this story.

First of all, for many years, I had this insecurity that I was not important to anyone. In every group I was a part of, I felt like I was there just because of the circumstances. Like I was a background NPC that accidentally walked into the cutscene.

I realized that thinking like that is actually extremely selfish. The truth was – it is not that deep, and most people really don't care. Not in an evil way. Just in a "they're busy being the main character in their own head" way.

Secondly, the fact that my parents lost their authority in telling right from wrong made me solely responsible for my choices. That's the way it ought to be, of course.

But when you have your parents' opinions affecting you your whole life, you don't even notice it. You get offended and defensive about things you didn't really choose. You think you're protecting your "values," and then later you realize you were just protecting inherited settings.

I am always open to healthy debate. But what I often encounter is people having preconceptions about things with no reason behind them. In such cases I always want to dig deeper and ask "Why?". Most of the time they don't know, and only a few can admit that they don't know. Usually they try to come up with an explanation on the spot.

Well, they must have gotten it somewhere, right? Most probably from their parents. Or from whoever raised them.

Losing that authority from my parents meant I had to reevaluate every single detail of my worldview and my behavior. That resulted in analyzing alternatives and making conscious choices with deliberate reasoning. I basically went through an unsolicited existential crisis in my late teens.

But the good part is that when I hear any kind of commentary from anyone else about myself – I expect it – and I know how to respond. I became immune to other people's opinions. I feel invincible to negative comments. This all sounds nice, but there is a catch.

Earlier, I said that there was no one to confront my father, and I am genuinely afraid that this will happen to me too. If I go unchecked just like my father – with all this education I have – man, I can hurt people. I am not trying to act tough. This shit is actually scary because of how is how easy it is to justify yourself when you're convinced you're right.

I fear becoming just like him and ending up living his life. I hope I am capable enough to put myself in check. Maybe that is the biggest battle every man has to fight once he loses his father. (Oh my god that was corny, but you get the point.)

He was the only one whose words had any weight for me, but then again, he beats his wife, so like, you know. And my mom just takes it. I have tremendous respect for my parents for what they have done, but I just can't take them seriously anymore. Almost anything that comes out of their mouth sounds like a joke at this point.

I don't have anyone that I can put above myself, someone I respect more than myself. It will sound kinda selfish given that earlier I abdicated the responsibility for being an example to younger siblings, but I think everybody should have someone like that.

Or is that what being an adult is? Is it that you have to be your own authority?

### The Identity Crisis

Everybody around me seems to have at least someone in their family who is exceptional, and/or a loving and supportive family. It leaves me wondering about where I came from. Am I extremely lucky, or is there someone in the family who is secretly a genius? Are my parents really the greatest parents alive, just a little unlucky? Or did I actually turn out to be a terrible person, and everyone I know is just pretending to like me?

If my parents could produce someone like me, do they have the capacity to change themselves and make things better, or are these people a lost cause? Am I the person I think I am? How much of who I am do I attribute to them? Do I get to take credit for my successes? Would I be the same person if my parents had been different? Would I have been more successful? Would I have been a better person?

See, if I accept that they had a great influence on me and then say that I hate them, it would mean I hate myself. I don't want that. If I say they and I are different, it is not entirely true. If I say I that I am "self-made", there are their efforts, without which I definitely couldn't have gotten to where I am right now. But if someone asks, I can't really proudly talk about them.

I was raised with the thought that knowing your roots is important. I've been told that you have to know where you came from, be grateful, and contribute back while simultaneously taking the responsibility to honor the legacy passed on to you. It gives a sense of belonging to something bigger than yourself. It keeps you grounded. It keeps you humble and in check.

But I don't have all that. I am not proud. I am ashamed. For that very reason, for a long time I couldn't talk about family matters with anyone. I don't want to associate myself with hypocrisy. Telling them that I am from there and giving them credit feels like agreeing that this lie works, and it is okay. Feels like I am telling a lie and passing it on.

This one is more of a meta problem I created for myself, and part of me thinks it doesn't fucking matter. I am old enough to be an individual. Whoever I become going forward doesn't necessarily have to be influenced by anyone from my family. Whatever I do now doesn't necessarily have to include anyone from my family. I am just scared of becoming an arrogant narcissistic prick who is full of himself.

## So What Now?

This kind of intellectual masturbation saves me from suffering from this situation emotionally.[^13] If you can explain it and prove that this was inevitable, there is no point in suffering from it, I guess.

Was this inevitable? I think yes. No matter how much love there is, if it is built on a lie, even a tiny one, it will pile up eventually. There is no single turning point I can point at and go, "this is where it all went south". The problems that led to this unfortunate situation were always there. No one cared enough to solve them. Everyone (!) just accepted it for 20 years and played pretend. Everybody worried for their own asses.

What upsets me is not the fact that I have this family. It's that I was sold the idea of a good family. I feel betrayed. I feel lied to. I don't want anything from them. I don't expect anything from them.

> I'm just sick and tired of hearing things from uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocrites. All I want is the truth now. Just gimme some truth now.

If I was their only child, I wouldn't even care. I'm sure they wouldn't either. Functionally, this "family" is long dead, at least for me. It holds only because there are underage kids.

But it's not like I don't want a father and a mother. A family. To be honest, I would trade everything I have right now for a better-off family. I hate to be that guy who forgives his parents, but I am. Because I honestly think no one is to blame. It really seems like there was no other way.

If I could choose between this family, with everything ending up exactly like it did, or no family at all, I'd still choose being raised by my parents.

I don't wish any harm to these people. If anything, I'm the one who wishes them well the most. I don't hate them, or have any kind of resentment againts them. I am biologically hard wired to love them, and I do.

The only thing I'm afraid of is someone dying. Or getting severe depression and then dying. I expect someone killing themselves, or each other. As they get older and crazier, paired with lifelong drinking and stress and all that, the odds of that happening get higher.

The thing I don't want to admit, but is true, is that I'm afraid not because I'd lose someone, but because I'd have to deal with the consequences.

However, I have a suspicion they don't even see this as something that serious. These people are built differently. Born and raised in a collapsing country, they've seen some shit. This might be a mild inconvenience for them while being the main story of my life.

Either way, they are the ones who have to deal with it because, frankly, I don't want to anymore. Fuck this shit. There is nothing I can do about it.

For the record, I'm not claiming to be smarter than people who raised four children, and I'm certainly not the person to tell them what to do. Maybe there are some things they've kept secret, and I shouldn't know them.

I also recognize that they are people with hopes and dreams that didn't get realized because of circumstances outside their control. I get that they don't wish harm to us. I realize there are people in far more terrible situations, with parents way worse than mine, or no parents at all. Compared to them, I'm very lucky.

But someone has to take action and eat the costs, and I don't want to be that person. I cost a lot of money to this country already, and I can't waste myself on an amateur low-budget cliché family drama, god damn it.

I thought about posting this. I can see the possible repercussions. I do care, and I made this decision consciously. Maybe if I can't do anything, I can at least expose this shit so they can't keep telling the lies that led to this.

To find the truth, you have to look at things at face value, stripped of moral judgment and emotional response. This is me trying to do that with the situation in my family.

Another thing is that I probably won't get the chance to express my thoughts or ask those questions. And even if I get a chance to talk to them, I don't think I could get through to them.

> Өмірді қиындатпасаң, қиын емес.

Which roughly translates to "Life ain't hard if you don't make it hard." This has been my motto for quite a while now. For me, this situation doesn't carry any emotional load anymore. It's just a fact now. I don't suffer from it. I just have it. The ultimate reason I am posting this after all is that I don't want to tell this story ever again.

Happy New Year and Jingle Bells!

[^1]: I have a long history of writing long ass texts, and my friends joke about it.
[^2]: I also never ask for help, even from my closest friends. It's not like I decide not to. I literally don't even have the thought. If it is something I can do myself, I do it. Or maybe it's not that deep and I've just never faced a "real problem" yet.
[^3]: Except for motorcycles because allegedly his father died in a motorcycle accident.
[^4]: I remember an episode from my early childhood, even before smartphones were a thing, when he took my scrambled Rubik's cube, went into the bedroom for three hours, and came out with a solved one! Well, of course, there's a chance that he took a nap for three hours and just disassembled and assembled it back, but the magic was there, and the impression he made stuck with me to this day.
[^5]: Pun intended, but I really was about that age.
[^6]: It happened when I was in 9th grade. I remember it because I was depressed. Boo-hoo me, but it fucked me up and I nearly lost all my friends. The table didn't cause it, but it sure as hell contributed.
[^7]: My dad had a funny story happen to him when he was on a train. One dude got drunk and got into a fight with his wife. He was about to hit her, and my dad allegedly stood up to protect her, hitting this dude. The funny part here is not the irony of my dad protecting a woman from a wife-beater. It is the wife who asked for help, screaming, "He is hitting my husband!" So it's kinda questionable whether you should step in or not.
[^8]: For the record, I am not gay. Nothing wrong with being gay.
[^9]: I am not that academically gifted, though. Good thing that I didn't feel any pressure on that front, because after some initial supervision in the first grade, my parents had nothing to do with how I studied. I did well enough for them not be involved and worried.
[^10]: Recently we won some money in a hackathon. I gave my part to my father as a birthday present. Then I got a message of approval via my mother. This was after he commented on my earring, so I felt like I claimed myself back. It felt like the ultimate achievement. What I realized from that single forwarded WhatsApp message was the fact that there is a "better way" of gaining confidence for a man – your father's approval.
[^11]: Interestingly, that was all me, because she never conditioned us against him. She kept his authority. Even if she was upset with him, it was all between the two of them.
[^12]: I have a very strange relationship with money. For the period that I am studying here, I am getting more than enough. I hear the folks around me say things like "I have to work because I can't ask my family" or whatnot, but I actually don't want that. And it's not because I love mooching off my parents. My father's money is the last connection I have with him. If I get financially independent, I would lose it. It is a ridiculous situation.
[^13]: I have been doing it since I was about 12. I even have some old notes still with me.
